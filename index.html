                  <p>The COVID- 19 pandemic across the globe is atypical. The Corona virus has brought the unpredicted fate in the 21st century (United Nations, n.d.). Something that has never happened in the 75-year history of the United Nations. As we all know, we were unprepared for this sort of catastrophic phase. The virus made a serious impact on the human race. People lost their belove ones, struggled for their lives and to sustain. The uninvited guest made our lives miserable, unpredictable, and hopeless in every aspect. We spent our lives for a year or more within our homes. Everything was restricted to online. At the initial stage, there were no protocols or guidelines to face this pandemic leading to disastrous episode. Every single chapter of human life were affected. Medical care, education, travel, food, and beverages and so on were struggling for existence (Impact of COVID-19 on People's Livelihoods, Their Health and Our Food Systems, 2020).</p>

                  <!--<h4>Financial Analysis<br>&amp; Consulting</h4>-->
                  <p>There were times when authorities were uncertain about the cause of admission. Hospitals were flooded with patients, schools and colleges were closed; people were unsure to go out for supplies. The human race was standstill! Even so, during the course of time, most of the countries managed to survive or minimalize the effect of pandemic with the continuous and rigorous efforts learned from similar or minor outbreaks and also by following certain standards and protocols suggested by the health professionals and WHO. The cause, the effect and the remedies were discovered by the scientists across the world. However, the uncertainty and delay in response lead the situation to result in high mortality rates.</p>

                  <p>The global pandemic is not yet over. We are unsuccessful in completely eradicating the virus from the world. The people and the government are still struggling to defeat the pandemic with a better plan and survive through it without affecting the people and the economy. The experience we acquired through this pandemic is huge. Now, we require a contingency plan which prepares us to go through such outbreaks. It is every evident that the world has to consider the possibility of another outbreak and thus we need to be more vigilant and prepared, given the world has tasted the bitter experience once. Everything in this world should and will play a key role in our preparation against another pandemic. 
This project is intended to prepare the Fraser Valley to overcome the hurdles and make them to strike against the pandemic with a better and effective plan.

                <p>The scope of this project spreads from researching and understanding the pandemic to construct a functional plan and deliverables which will make the Fraser Valley to defeat another outbreak. A dedicated team will be hired to study and research the whole situation and also to learn how different countries handled and overcome this pandemic globally. Furthermore, surveys will be conducted to know what people in the Fraser Valley thinks about what went wrong, and how this pandemic has affected their lives. Concurrently, based on our experiences we gained through surviving the situation from 2019 will be considered and build a system where we will be ready with enough medical facilities and medical professionals, strategies which will make sure our daily livelihoods are unaffected.</p>

The whole project will be divided into smaller manageable components with an individual deadline which will be delivered as per schedule. The project breakdown will allow the team members to handle and deliver the project goals more efficiently and will also help the stakeholders to understand the status of the project in a clear manner. The project is calculated to follow spiral model. We will kick start to develop the project deliverables along with the research and survey based on the experience that we gained by surviving the last year. We are expecting changes to be adapted as we get our hands on the reports made by our research team.</p>

Mental models can be considered as a map which takes us through someone's thought process on how things should work in the real world, their perception on their acts, consequences, and measures about how solve problems that we encounter("Mental Model," 2021). Informational reports will provide us facts, feedbacks, and other relevant information on the covid impacts.

             <p>
              A feedback analysis will be conducted through our website to understand what went wrong, what are the effective measures that made us through this pandemic. Survey will also be conducted at stores and shops, where the consumers can suggest how the public interactions can be improved without causing a catastrophe. Regular analysis of these surveys will be performed, and the report should be submitted to the health officers and the Implementation team for review.

             <p>
             Unceasing awareness programs and vaccination drives will be planned in and around Fraser Valley till we reach 100% vaccinated rate. Public should be highly motivated towards the need to vaccination, thus a very key factor to resist the pandemic. Educational Institutions and recreational centres will be advised to provide awareness, proper verification of vaccination. Vaccination Stalls and centres will be launched at easily accessible public places and malls.

            A website application where users like health care authorities and retail stores can record information regarding their necessities and availabilities. Some examples are given below.
            
            <ol>
             <br>
             <li>Number of beds available/ needed</li>

             <li>Information about test centres and vaccination drives</li>
             <li>Retail stores can record their needs through this website. Suppliers would be able to communicate to the stores and can provide goods at reasonable rates. The difference in loss can be sufficed by the government funds to ensure both parties are satisfied</li>

              <li>
           <p>Before acquiring resources, an estimation procedure will be involved to estimate the resources needed to complete the work.

             Procurement management will be handled carefully as it involves large amount of scope, time, and cost of our project. The project team will closely work with the suppliers to ensure a smooth procurement process. All the resources coming through external vendors should follow an approval process which goes through the project core team and a quality check process done by our quality control team.  Below resources are planned to acquire through outsourcing.

             <p>
            
           This project holds a high degree of risk factors as it involves human lives, financial stability, and social well-being. Risk analysis will be conducted in a regular interval identifying possible risks and threats which will be deeply monitored by our team. Our risk management team will propose preventive measures to reduce the probability of risk occurrences. Contingency allowances are included in the cost that can be utilized during emergency situations.

           <h4><b>SWOT Analysis</b></h4>
           <br>
           
             <p>
          <b>Strength:</b>  Accessibility of skilled resources in health care, information technology, economy and public administration can be considered as a positive sign towards the success probability of the project. Since we are going through the survival process already, kick starting the project will be way easier since we have enough information and analysis based on the past year experience. 
             </p>
             
              <p>
          <b>Weakness:</b>  Occurrences of unknown risks are high. For example, virus undergoing mutations forming new variant could change the direction of the project because the situation can demand to execute contingency plans which can put halt on the project. Even though we have skilled medical experts in Fraser Valley, the strength of them shall be questioned. Acquiring the needed resources could be a tough game. 
             </p>
             
              <p>
          <b>Opportunity:</b>  The completion of this project will be a tremendous victory and will be marked in the global history. Committing this project is giving us a golden opportunity to work with and to get inspired by the field experts. Experience gained through this project is huge and countable. The success of this project could lead to get more commitments with the federal government.
             </p>
             
             <p>
          <b>Threat:</b>  Since the project involves some factors that cannot be controlled by humans, some of the risk factors involved with the project is also unknown and unpredicted. Since the project will make an impact on multiple levels of the human life, any minor mistakes could lead to enormous loss. Below risks can be anticipated during the project life cycle.
          <ol>
            <li>Detection of new virus variant</li>
            <li>Unable to produce enough human and other physical resources as expected</li>
            <li>Delays in supplies as there are restrictions on working properly dur to outbreak</li>
            <li>Resistant attitude by the people toward the implementation of the project</li>
